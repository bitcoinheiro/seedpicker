## Bitcoin Seed Phrase Recovery Sheet
*This sheet is designed for long term storage of one Bitcoin Seed Phrase.
Print it on paper and secretly write down your 24 seed phrase words by hand.*

### What is this?
The 24 words below together make up a secret "seed phrase" constructed according
to the Bitcoin BIP39 standard. A seed phrase is a list of words which store all 
the information needed to recover a Bitcoin wallet.

An additional "pass phrase" (a long password, sometimes called the 25th word)
is another component of the BIP39 standard. Depending on the intended use of the
seed phrase below, a BIP39 pass phrase may or may not be necessary.

For security reasons, the secret words ***should never be entered into a computer***.
When the time comes to access the cryptocurrency (or other secret information)
protected by this seed phrase, a ***hardware wallet*** should be used. A hardware
wallet is an ultra-secure device build specifically for this purpose. It can
generate many different private keys from one seed phrase, and each private key
can, in turn, generate a public Bitcoin address, using a one-way cryptographic function.

### Storage
It is recommended to make at least two copies of this sheet. The same goes for the
pass phrase, if used. Make the copies manually, do not use a copier or a camera.
Store all copies in different, safe locations. Most importantly, do not store the
seed phrase and the pass phrase in the same location!
If possible, use some kind of tamper-evident bag or container.
