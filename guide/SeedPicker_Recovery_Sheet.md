## Bitcoin Seed Phrase Recovery Sheet
*This sheet is designed for long term storage of a Bitcoin Seed Phrase. 
Print it and secretly write down your 24 seed phrase words using a pen.* 

### Instructions
The 24 words below together make up a "seed phrase" constructed according to the BIP39 standard. A seed phrase is a list of words which store all the information needed to recover a Bitcoin wallet. 

An additional "pass phrase" (a long password, sometimes called the 25th word) is another component of the BIP39 standard. Depending on the intended use of the seed phrase below, a BIP39 pass phrase may or may not be necessary. 

These secret words should be written using pen and paper and _should never be entered into a computer_. 
To use the seed phrase to spend cryptocurrency, a hardware wallet should be used. A hardware wallet is a small ultra-secure device that can generate many different private keys from one seed phrase. (Each private key can generate a public Bitcoin address, using a one-way cryptographic function.) If you don't have a hardware wallet you should buy one.

### Storage
It is recommended to make at least two copies of this sheet. The same goes for the pass phrase, if used. Make the copies manually, not using a copier or a camera. Store all copies in different, safe locations. Most importantly, do not store the seed phrase and the pass phrase in the same location!
